## Introduction to the artwork 

The artwork is a Dream-time style artwork, which is audio-animated so that when the "Play/Pause" button is pressed, the artwork moves according to the amplitude and the frequency of the artwork in a Dreamtime style. 
The music is found from the link below:

## Individual approach

For the individual approach to the artwork, I chose audio as the main function of focus. 
As being more diverse from other people of my group, I decided to use a more creative and culturally-inspired approach, where the roundness and repetition of the wheels made me think of Indigenous Art, and inspired me to create that into something that is culturally diverse. In addition, I have used the approach of using simplistic colors, or a limited color palette, especially using negative colors, such as lighter colors against a dark background to create a abstract and eerie effect. In this project, I used a free experimentation approach, where I don't put down a shape for the sake of the pattern being there, but to work around the space that I have and explore the free feeling of movement. These includes, not setting a certain size of the shape, or a certain shape. 

_Note on the use of functions instead of classes_
I have found it difficult to use the class system, to individually create the elements of the artwork so I varied the code into functions.

*References for the artwork*

I have been inspired mainly by indigenous art, especially the use of wheels and circles, and shapes, to create animals and wildlife. 
Below, is a link to an example of an image with a similar color palette, using different shades of blue ranging from dark blue to bright light blue and wheels to create this image.

##Main Coding Techniques

The main coding techniques I have used are listed below: 

1.  Map volume to size for animation, learned from https://editor.p5js.org/cs4all/sketches/rybEComzV
2.  Draw the pattern with animated size, listing draw patterns in an array, retrieved from https://editor.p5js.org/aferriss/sketches/HkE6v-y9z
3.  Adding preload sound and click button function, learned from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn1g1wjxl_0&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain
4. Learned FFT audio analysis function, and tried to incorporate that into the artwork to make the artwork more lively - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O3nm0Nvbi4&list=PLEtC2iwVrNRaOCqVYOB_B4B0Rx4rz2n7Q&index=2&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain
