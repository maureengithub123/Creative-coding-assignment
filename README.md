## Introduction to the artwork 

The artwork is a Dream-time style artwork, which is audio-animated so that when the "Play/Pause" button is pressed, the artwork moves according to the amplitude and the frequency of the artwork in a Dreamtime style.

## Individual approach

For the individual approach to the artwork, I chose audio as the main function of focus. 
As being more diverse from other people of my group, I decided to use a more creative and culturally-inspired approach, where the roundness and repetition of the wheels made me think of Indigenous Art, and inspired me to create that into something that is culturally diverse. In addition, I have used the approach of using simplistic colors, or a limited color palette, especially using negative colors, such as lighter colors against a dark background to create a abstract and eerie effect.
