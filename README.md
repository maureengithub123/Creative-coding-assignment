## Introduction to the artwork 

The artwork is a Dream-time style artwork, which is audio-animated so that when the "Play/Pause" button is pressed, the artwork moves according to the amplitude and the frequency of the artwork in a Dreamtime style.

## Individual approach

For the individual approach to the artwork, I chose audio as the main function of focus. 
As being more diverse from other people of my group, I decided to use a more creative and culturally-inspired approach, where the roundness and repetition of the wheels made me think of Indigenous Art, and inspired me to create that into something that is culturally diverse. In addition, I have used the approach of using simplistic colors, or a limited color palette, especially using negative colors, such as lighter colors against a dark background to create a abstract and eerie effect. In this project, I used a free experimentation approach, where I don't put down a shape for the sake of the pattern being there, but to work around the space that I have and explore the free feeling of movement. These includes, not setting a certain size of the shape, or a certain shape. 

*References for the artwork*

I have been inspired mainly by indigenous art, especially the use of wheels and circles, and shapes, to create animals and wildlife. 
Below, is a link to an example of an image with a similar color palette, using different shades of blue ranging from dark blue to bright light blue and wheels to create this image.
